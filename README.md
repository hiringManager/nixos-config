# nixos-config

### Figure out what deps are needed for the awesome.git 
*     Can I source them locally? -- build-dep from sid or someshit
* What's the process of all this wizardry + Find a build visualizer
* **AFTER YOU FAIL AT THESE --** See if it's available on another Channel -- someone else's repo

### When you rebuild, don't fuck around with the paths or .config/nix/def.conf or whatever
*   Sort the ZSH + npx shenanigans that are rekt
*     oh-my-zsh more like slow-my-zsh lol
*   Don't forget about the **nfs.patch in wsl**
